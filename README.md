Example corto projects

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cortoproject/examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cortoproject/examples)

To run these examples, make sure you have installed the Corto project. Because Corto v1.0 has not yet been released, public binaries might be out of date with the current examples. In order to run the eexamples, it is recommended to build Corto from source.

Examples are organized by language/category. Currently, we only have examples for the C programming language.
