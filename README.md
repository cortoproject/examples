Example corto projects

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cortoproject/examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cortoproject/examples)

To run these examples, make sure you have installed the Corto project. Because Corto v1.0 has not yet been released, public binaries might be out of date and examples might rely on newer versions of the API. In order to run the examples, it is recommended to build Corto from source.

Examples are organized by language/category. Currently, we only have examples for the C programming language.
