This project shows an example replicator package that mounts a file system under a Corto scope.

The replicator is most fun to use with the Corto shell, as it turns it into a Linux-style filebrowser:

To use the project as a regular package, do `corto build` from the FileBrowser directory, and then `corto add <yourproject> FileBrowser`.
